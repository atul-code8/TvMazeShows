I'm create a basic UI to display the show names and a few details about it to display along with the show name. Include a button for each of the shows to redirect the user to another screen that shows the summary of the particular show.
Refer to the api structure. You will find a summary section for each show there
It has to be a React JS application.
It has to implement the API and not just hardcode data from the API.
It has to have 2 screens at a minimum. One to display a few data and possibly an image(UI is completely up to you) and another screen to show it’s summary.
The second screen should have a button to book a movie ticket which will open a form with the movie name already present and a few relevant details.
(Reload should not happen)
A proper UI so that we know you have a good understanding of UI/UX. Doesn’t need to have mind blowing animations but just basic HTML and CSS styling that looks good (I have use TailwindCSS).
